# Grok-backdoor

Grok-backdoor is a simple python based backdoor, it uses Ngrok tunnel for the C&C communication. Ngrok-backdoor can generate Windows, Linux and Mac binaries using Pyinstaller.

## How it works:

Ngrok exposes local servers behind NATs and firewalls to the public internet over a secure tunnel.

Ngrok establishes a tunnel between malware local listerner port and ngrok server public IP over a unique port number. Attacker can connect Ngrok public IP and unique port to intract with internal malware listerner.

## Dependencies:
Python 2.7

Pyinstaller 3.21

python-pip 9.0.1 


## Installation :
pip install -r requirements.txt


### Usage: 

You need a ngrok.com acccount to use this backdoor, you can provide Ngrok authcode while configuring the grok-backdoor. You will be able to see a new tcp tunnel created in Ngrok status panel after the grok-backdoor server execution on victim machine

Create backdoor binary by running : 

python grok-backdoor.py

#### Linux:

#### Windows :

You can find the output binary in grok-backdoor/dist/ directory:

Telnet to tunnel URL to get the Bind shell: Enjoy shell :)

### How to embed ngrok binary with the backdoor?

choose No when grok-backdoor ask for "Do you want to download Ngrok binary during execution?". If you choose 'N' it will bind ngrok with the output backdoor binary

### Proxy Blocking ngrok download attempt while backdoor execution?

Choose bind ngrok binary with malware option to bypass proxy blocking.


### Features:
* Multi platform support(windows,linux,Mac) - No cross compiling at the moment, you need to run this code in respective platforms to generate executables for different platforms.
* Autheticated bind shell
* Random output binary
* Ngrok tunnel support to bypass firewall/proxy restrictions.
